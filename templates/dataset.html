                The UCI have their own Machine Learning Repository and they currently maintain 588 data sets as a
                service to the machine learning community. Here, you can donate and find data sets used by millions of
                people all around the world!

                The Heart Disease dataset consists of 14 attributes in total out of which 13 attributes are asked to the
                patient to predict the value of the final, 14th attribute which states whether a person has a heart
                disease or not! There are a total of 303 rows of data in this dataset.

                    <b>Asymptomatic Chest Pain</b>: Asymptomatic heart attacks medically known as silent myocardial
                    infarction (SMI) annually accounts for around 45-50% of morbidities due to cardiac ailments and even
                    premature deaths in India. The incidences among middle aged people experiencing SMI is twice as
                    likely to develop in males than females. The symptoms of SMI being very mild in comparison to an
                    actual heart attack; it is described as a silent killer. Unlike the symptoms in a normal heart
                    attack which includes extreme chest pain, stabbing pain in the arms, neck & jaw, sudden shortness of
                    breath, sweating and dizziness, the symptoms of SMI are very brief and hence confused with regular
                    discomfort and most often ignored.

                    <b>Non-Anginal Pain</b>: Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is a term used to describe chest pain that
                    resembles heart pain (also called angina) in patients who do not have heart disease. The pain
                    typically is felt behind the breast bone (sternum) and is described as oppressive, squeezing or
                    pressure-like. It may radiate to the neck, left arm or the back (the spine). It may be precipitated
                    by food intake. It lasts variable periods of time and it is not unusual for it to last hours.
                    Patients may also complain of associated reflux symptoms such as heartburn (a burning feeling behind
                    the breast bone) or fluid regurgitation (a sensation of stomach juices coming back toward the chest
                    and even to the mouth frequently with a bitter or sour taste).

            <p calss="written eight">
                A blood sample will be taken after an overnight fast. A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL
                (5.6 mmol/L) is normal. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is
                considered prediabetes. If it's 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes.
            </p>
            <h3 class="heading sub five">Resting Blood Pressure</h3>
            <p class="written nine">
                Blood pressure is a measure of the force that your heart uses to pump blood around your body.
            </p>
            <p class="written nine one">
                Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) and is given as 2 figures:

            <h3 class="heading sub six">Serum Cholesterol Levels</h3>
            <p class="written ten">
                Cholesterol is often associated with heart disease. That’s because low-density lipoproteins (LDL) can
                build up in your arteries and restrict or block blood flow. Your body still needs a little cholesterol
                for healthy digestion and to make vitamin D and certain hormones.
            </p>
            <p class="written ten one">
                Cholesterol is a type of fat. It’s also called a lipid. It travels through your bloodstream in tiny
                molecules wrapped inside proteins. These packages are called lipoproteins. LDL is one of the main types
                of lipoproteins in your blood. The other main type is high-density lipoproteins (HDL). A third type of
                lipid, called a triglyceride, also circulates in your blood. The serum cholesterol level is measured in
                <b>mg/dl</b>.

            <p class="written ten two">

            <p class="written twelve">
                This attribute basically states whether an angina is invoked during the exercise of your body in which
                your heart has to work harder to maintain the flow of blood.
            </p>
            <h3 class="heading sub nine">Resting Electrocardiographic Results</h3>
            <p class="written thirteen">
                Resting 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) is a non-invasive test that can detect abnormalities including
                arrhythmias, evidence of coronary heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy and bundle branch blocks.
                In the preoperative setting, resting ECG is used to assess known cardiovascular diseases, to detect
                previously undiagnosed cardiovascular diseases, and to provide a baseline standard against which to
                measure changes in the postoperative period. When conducted by a suitably trained individual, the
                resting ECG is simple to perform and interpret, with the only described complication being minor allergy
                to the ECG electrodes resulting in self-limiting skin reddening. However, there is uncertainty regarding
                the prognostic significance of different resting ECG abnormalities in the perioperative setting,
                especially in asymptomatic patients.
            </p>
            <p class="written thirteen one">
                In the form, there are 3 possible values you can fill in this attribute in accordance to your ECG

            <h3 class="heading sub ten">Slope of the peak exercise ST Segment</h3>
            <p class="written fourteen">
                This is the slope of the ST Segment depression which can be found by taking the Electrocardiographic
                test. There are 3 possible values associated with the slope:
            <ol>
                <li>Normal</li>
                <li>Downsloping</li>

            <p class="written fifteen">
                This is a value that can also be found out in the ECG report. ST depression in ECG at entry indicates
                severe coronary lesions and large benefits of an early invasive treatment strategy in unstable coronary
                artery disease.

                Fluoroscopy is like an imaging tool in the field of medical science, similar to an animated version of
                an X-Ray. In cardiac catheterization, fluoroscopy is used to help the healthcare provider see the flow
                of blood through the coronary arteries. It can check for arterial blockages. Fluoroscopy uses a dye to
                put it on a vein or vessel to observe it clearly for further examination.
            </p>
            <h3 class="heading sub thirteen">Thalium Stress Test</h3>
            <p class="written seventeen">
                A thallium stress test is a nuclear imaging test that shows how well blood flows into your heart while
                you’re exercising or at rest. This test is also called a cardiac or nuclear stress test.
            </p>
            <p class="written eighteen">
                During the procedure, a liquid with a small amount of radioactivity called a radioisotope is
                administered into one of your veins. The radioisotope will flow through your bloodstream and end up in
                your heart. Once the radiation is in your heart, a special camera called a gamma camera can detect the
                radiation and reveal any issues your heart muscle is having.

            <p class="written nineteen">
                There are 3 possible values you can input in the form after taking the thallium test:
