Cardio-Fit is a **Machine Learning based Web Application.** It can detect whether *you are suffering from a heart disease or not*. It also creates a **personalised analytical report** depending upon your test result.

## 🎥 Demo
This demo shows how you will input the data and based on that, the ML model will predict the result along side your *personalized analytical report*.

## 🤖 Under the hood

Cardio-Fit works on a Machine Learning model made with the **Ensemble Technique** which enables it to give us a better overall result.

The model has been selected after properly visualizing and understanding the data through *statistical* means, to find the best possible features, which are most impactful to our model.
